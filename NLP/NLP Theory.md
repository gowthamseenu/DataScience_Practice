Natural Language Processing:
- Text mining / Text Analytics is the process of driving meaningful information from natural language text
- NLP : is a part of computer science and artificial intelligence which deals with human languages

Applications of Natural Language Processing:
- Sentimental Analysis
- Chatbot
- Speech Recognition
- Machine Translation
- Spell Checking
- Keyword Searching
- Information Extraction
- Advertisement Matching

Natural Language Processing is divided into two parts:
- Natural Language Understanding
- Natural Language Generation

Natural Language Understanding:
- First mapping the given input into natural language into a useful representation and analysing those aspect of the lang.

Natural Language Generation:
- It is the process of producing meaningful phrases and sentences in the form of natural language form internal representation.

Various Steps involved in Natural Language Processing:
- Tokenization
- Stemming
- Lemmatization
- POS Tags
- Named Entity Recognition
- Chunking

Tokenization:
- It is the process of breaking strings into tokens which inturn a small structures or units that can be used for Tokenization.
Ex: Tokenization is the first step in NLP
    Tokens: 
    - Tokenization
    - is
    - the
    - first
    - step
    - in
    - NLP
    
Stemming:
- It refers to Normalize words into its base form or root form
Ex: Affection-------------|
    Affects               |
    Affections            |   Stemming
    Affected              |==============> Affect
    Affectation           |
    Affecting-------------|
    
Lemmatization:
- Gropus together different inflected forms of a word, called lemma
- Somehow similar to stemming, as it maps several words into one common root
- Output of Lemmatisation is a proper word
- For example, a Lemmatiser should map "gone", "going" and "went" into "go"
- Logical analysis of the word
- It is necessary to have detailed dictionary from which algorithm can look through

POS Tags:
- Grammatical type of the word are the parts of speech.
- Noun, Verb, Adverb, Adjective, Aricle
- It indicates how a word function in meaning as well as grammatically between the sentences
- Ex: "Google" something on the internet
       where "Google" is Verb / Noun
       
Named Entity Recognition(NER):
- It is the process of detecting the Name and its person Name, Company Name, Quantities and Location.
- It has 3 Steps:
   - Noun Phase Identification
   - The Phrase classification
   - Entity Disambigation
- Ex: Google's CEO Sundar Pichai introduced the new pixel3 at NewYork Central Mall
      where,
            Organization   :   Google, Central Mall
            Person         :   Sundar Pichai
            Location       :   NewYork
            
Chunking:
- It means picking up individual pieces of information and Grouping them into bigger pieces
